# About php-soap

We aim to replace PHP's internal SOAP implementation based on modern practices and code, so that you can focus on the implementation instead of bugs!

This project was born out of the needs of [phpro/soap-client](https://github.com/phpro/soap-client).
It contains an extraction of the low-level structure of the soap-client package.
The packages inside the php-soap organisation can be used completely stand-alone and provide well-proven structures for doing SOAP as flexible as possible.
