# Want to help out? ðŸ’š

Our mission is to provide a modern full replacement for PHP's ext-soap in the far future.
Given the big amount of SOAP related bugs in PHP, this isn't an easy job to complete.
We want to make sure we provide you a better alternative, but this absorbs a lot of time!
More than we can handle. That is why wee need your help!

What can you do in order to make us succeed in our mission?

## Sponsor

We've got some [big projects](PROJECTS.md) coming up in the near future.

You can find the next big things we will be working on and help us make time to build it.
If you are satisfied about this project or if we helped you out in any ways, feel free to thank us with any donation. 

## Let us do your implementation!

You can hire one of our experts to help you out with any SOAP implementation you need to take care of.
Not only will we transfer all learned gains from your project back into our code, 
we will invest the profit from your project back into this project.
Just like sponsoring, this will help us shipping our [next big project](PROJECTS.md).

## Maintain

We spend a lot of time helping out people with SOAP related issues.
It might be a bug in our code, in PHP's code, at the user's end, ...
Every answer helps us improving this package.
We can always use additional SOAP gurus that help us answer questions or getting small features merged.

## Ask for help!

If you have any question regarding SOAP in general: ask it!
We have a lot of SOAP experience and will be able to find an answer for you.
If we don't know the answer, we can search for a solution and implement it back in this package.
So it's a win-win!
